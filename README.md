# real-estate-database

This is a mock database used to simulate a real estate environment.  
Built from the ground up, starting with the ERR diagram, then implemented the scripts.  

**MUST HAVE MS SSMS OR MYSQL OR ORACLE to use!!!

Steps: run the scripts in numbered order. 1 = create tables, 2 = fill tables with data, 3 = run the queries/tests, 4 = drop tables when finished.
